# Wazuh Open Source Security Platform

Wazuh is a free, open source and enterprise-ready security monitoring solution for threat detection, integrity monitoring, incident response and compliance.

This process is simple and easy to setup. All we have to do is inport the **.ova** file into out HyperVisor and run the system.

- Note: Information is taken from the website below:
~~~
This virtual appliance, available here, contains the following components:

CentOS 7
Wazuh manager: 4.0.2
Open Distro for Elasticsearch: 7.9.1
Filebeat-OSS: 7.9.1
Kibana: 7.9.1
Wazuh Kibana plugin: 4.0.2-7.9.1
~~~

- First, import the OVA in the virtualization platform and run the virtual machine. The user root password is wazuh and the username/password for the Wazuh API is wazuh-wui/wazuh-wui. The following video explains how to import and run the virtual machine.

To access the web interface:

URL: https://<wazuh_server_ip>
user: admin
password: admin
~~~

- Note:

By default the type of the network interface is bridge. The VM will try to get an IP address from the networkâ€™s DHCP server. Alternatively, a static IP address can be set by configuring the proper network files on the CentOS operating system that the virtual machine is based on.
